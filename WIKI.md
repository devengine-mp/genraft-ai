## Assistants and Their Roles

In the generative AI application creation process, the following roles, envisioned as AI agents, are integral for ensuring a smooth flow from conception to documentation:

### Assistants Creation Phase

- Here assistants will be created!

### Designing Phase

- **Stakeholder**: To help discuss the initial product idea.
- **Consultant**: To help Refine and give details to the initial product idea.
- **CTO (Chief Technology Officer)**: Deals with technical aspects including architecture, technology stack, and integration requirements.

### Coding Phase

- **Programmer**: Translates technical specifications into executable code and develops the core functionalities of the product.
- **Designer**: Responsible for creating the visual aspects of the product, including UI/UX design, logos, and other design assets.

### Testing Phase

- **Tester**: Performs various types of testing like functional, integration, and system testing to ensure the product is bug-free and meets quality standards.

### Documenting Phase

- **Technical Writer**: Specializes in creating technical documentation, including code documentation, API manuals, and system architecture diagrams.
- **User Documentation**: Focuses on creating end-user documentation, such as user manuals, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides.

Each role contributes its expertise to the collaborative development of the AI application, simulating relevant conversations and activities within each phase.

## Process and Workflow

### 1. Assistants Creation Phase

**Goal**: To set up the foundational elements for the project by creating the necessary AI assistants.

- **Stages**: Creation of all assistants.

### 2. Designing Phase

**Goal**: To refine the initial product idea and to develop product feature specifications.

#### Chat 1: Stakeholder and Idea Consultant

- **Topic**: Fleshing out the initial product idea.
- **Input**: Short product idea.
- **Output**: Detailed product idea.

#### Chat 2: CEO and CTO

- **Topic**: Technical challenges, architecture, and integration with existing technologies.
- **Input**: Detailed product idea and company goals.
- **Output**: Detailed technical specifications, architecture, and tech stack requirements.

### 3. Coding Phase

**Goal**: To translate the technical specifications into executable code and design assets.

#### Chat 1: CTO and Programmer

- **Focus**: Active feature implementation based on the technical plan.
- **Input**: Detailed technical plan including specifications and tech stack.
- **Output**: Executable source code for specified features, adhering to technical specifications.

#### Chat 2: Programmer and Designer

- **Focus**: Creation and provision of UI/UX design assets for project implementation.
- **Input**: Product design specifications and UX strategy.
- **Output**: UI/UX design assets, including logos, UI elements, mockups, and style guides, ready for implementation in the project.

### 4. Testing Phase

**Goal**: To ensure the software is functional, optimized, and free of major bugs.

#### Chat 2: Programmer and Tester

- **Topic**: Functional and structural testing of the software.
- **Input**: Source code and features.
- **Output**: Test reports including unit, integration, and system testing results.

### 5. Documenting Phase

**Goal**: To create comprehensive documentation for both technical and end-user aspects.

#### Chat 1: CTO and Technical Writer

- **Topic**: Creating comprehensive technical documentation.
- **Input**: Technical specifications, architecture details, and source code.
- **Output**: Technical documentation such as API documentation, code documentation, system architecture diagrams, and development guides.

#### Chat 2: CEO and User Documentation 

- **Topic**: Developing end-user documentation.
- **Input**: Product specifications, UX/UI design details, and user interface prototypes.
- **Output**: End-user documentation including user manuals, how-to guides, FAQs, and troubleshooting instructions.

This framework ensures a systematic approach to developing a generative AI application, with each phase building upon the previous one. The AI agents in different roles simulate relevant conversations to produce the necessary outputs for each phase, making the development process efficient and structured.
