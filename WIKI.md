## Assistants and Their Roles

In the generative AI application creation process, the following roles, envisioned as AI agents, are integral for ensuring a smooth flow from conception to documentation:

### Idea Creation Phase
1. **Stakeholder**: Provides the initial product idea and has a vested interest in the project's success.
2. **Idea Consultant**: Assists in refining and detailing the product idea.

### Company Creation Phase
3. **CEO (Chief Executive Officer)**: Sets the strategic direction of the company and oversees the alignment of the product with company goals.
4. **COO (Chief Operating Officer)**: Responsible for operational strategy, resource allocation, and defining new roles specific to the project.

### Designing Phase
5. **CPO (Chief Product Officer)**: Focuses on product design specifications, user experience strategy, and preliminary prototypes.
6. **CTO (Chief Technology Officer)**: Deals with technical aspects including architecture, technology stack, and integration requirements.

### Coding Phase
7. **Programmer**: Translates technical specifications into executable code and develops the core functionalities of the product.
8. **Designer**: Responsible for creating the visual aspects of the product, including UI/UX design, logos, and other design assets.

### Testing Phase
9. **Reviewer**: Conducts code reviews, offers performance optimization suggestions, and ensures coding standards are met.
10. **Tester**: Performs various types of testing like functional, integration, and system testing to ensure the product is bug-free and meets quality standards.

### Documenting Phase
11. **Technical Writer**: Specializes in creating technical documentation, including code documentation, API manuals, and system architecture diagrams.
12. **User Documentation Specialist**: Focuses on creating end-user documentation, such as user manuals, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides.

Each role contributes its expertise to the collaborative development of the AI application, simulating relevant conversations and activities within each phase.
